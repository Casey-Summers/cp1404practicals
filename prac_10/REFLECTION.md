## CP1404 Final Reflection - Casey Summers

# Time management and estimation:
I believe that my time estimates became far more accurate as I continued completing practical tasks. I was able to gain
a brief understanding of a task and split it into portions that I could attribute a time for. However, my estimates were 
not perfect, and sometimes I would not account for getting stuck on certain concept, which greatly exceeded some time
frames. For example, the project_management program I estimated 90m, but it ended up taking 150m to complete. Going forward
I will continue to practise time estimation, and refine my expected vs actual accuracy.

# Code reviews:
- Being review:
I found the reviews very helpful coming from a fellow student, as they were able to reword or clarify tough topics in a 
new personalised way. Not only this, but also the fact that the reviews can provide a great insight into how
other students are thinking, and what I can do to follow or adapt that process.

- Conducting reviews:
I found the process of reviewing very rewarding, as it challenged me to extend my knowledge and provide insightful feedback 
whilst affirming my own understanding. For instance, when correcting someone's code, I needed to ensure I was speaking in
correct terms, and in a way that was clear enough to understand and learn from.

# Practical Task Feedback:
For students, such as myself, sometimes it is the small habits that can be easily forgotten that need hammering in.
For instance, I found myself forgetting to add some docstrings/comments where required, or messing up the code review 
process with Git. Additional reminders and multiple examples of the simple things, otherwise passed of as understood topics,
would be very handy.
